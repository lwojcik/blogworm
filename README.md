ðŸ‘‰ [Site is here](https://blogworm.eu/)

## I'm an author of blog you added to this site, could you change something about it / delete my blog entirely?

Yes! [Contact me](https://lukaszwojcik.net/contact/) or [submit an issue](https://github.com/lwojcik/blogworm.eu/issues/new).

## Can you add my blog?

See [About](https://blogworm.eu/about/) page.

## Can I fork this site and set up my own?

Yes! It's a static site built with Eleventy. I'm working on detailed instructions on how to do it, stay tuned.

If you're feeling adventurous right now - clone the repo, modify the list of sites you want to track (it's in `content/sites` directory), edit the site as you see fit and deploy it somewhere (e.g. on Netlify or Vercel).

To run a scheduled build (i.e. have your site updated) you can use GitHub Actions. [I run my own one](https://github.com/lwojcik/github-action-deploy-static-site) but there are others in the [Marketplace](github.com/marketplace?type=actions)).
