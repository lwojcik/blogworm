**Blogworm** is an aggregator of blogs written by fantastic people I met on the internet.

I love blogs. I appreciate people who write them. Blogworm is my love letter to the blogosphere and the independent web.

Apart from being my personal feed reader, I want this site to amplify wide range of interesting voices that would otherwise get lost in my social media feeds.

And that name? Blogworm, like "[bookworm](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/bookworm)", but for blogs. Get it? üôÉ

## And you are... who?

I'm [≈Åukasz](https://lukaszwojcik.net). Hailing from Warsaw, Poland. Nice to meet you! üëã

## Can I suggest my blog?

Sorry, not at the moment. I have a sizable backlog of blogs to process. I'll be adding them in small batches over time.

If we already met before (e.g. talked on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@lukem)?) - there's non-zero chance your blog is already on my list.

If not, stay tuned. I'll update this section once I'm ready to accept submissions.

## My blog is already here but I want to change something

Sure! [Contact me](https://lukaszwojcik.net/contact/) or [submit a GitHub issue](https://github.com/lwojcik/blogworm.eu/issues/new). I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

## Can I have a site like this for myself?

Yes! This site is relatively uncomplicated. I'm still working on the tutorial explaining how to do it, stay tuned. You can also check out [project code on GitHub](https://github.com/lwojcik/blogworm.eu).
