**Blogworm** is an aggregator of blogs written by fantastic people I met on the internet.

I love blogs. I appreciate people who write them. Blogworm is my love letter to the blogosphere and the independent web.

Apart from being my personal feed reader, I want this site to amplify wide range of interesting voices that would otherwise get lost in my social media feeds.

And that name? Blogworm, like "[bookworm](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/bookworm)", but for blogs. Get it? üôÉ

## And you are... who?

I'm [≈Åukasz]({{ siteConfig.author.homepage }}). Hailing from Warsaw, Poland. Nice to meet you! üëã

## Can I suggest my blog?

Sorry, not at the moment. I have a sizable backlog of blogs to process and I'll be adding them in small batches over time.

If we have already met before (e.g. talked on [Mastodon]({{ siteConfig.author.mastodon }})?) - there's a non-zero chance your blog is already on my list and I'll reach out to you soon.

If not, stay tuned. I'll update this section once I'm ready to accept submissions.

## My blog is already here but I want to change something

Sure! [Contact me]({{ siteConfig.author.contact }}) or [submit a GitHub issue]({{ siteConfig.github.issue }}). I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

## Can I have a site like this for myself?

Yes! This site is relatively uncomplicated. I'm still working on the tutorial explaining how to do it, stay tuned. You can, however, grab a [starter template for a site like this](https://github.com/lwojcik/eleventy-template-multiplicity) or check out [project code on GitHub]({{ siteConfig.github.project }}).
